# MHATCN_Snow_Albedo_Forecasting
Snow albedo plays a critical role in regulating surface energy balance and climate processes, particularly in complex mountainous environments like Himalayans. However, existing snow albedo prediction approaches often struggle to simultaneously capture short-term variability and long-range temporal dependencies.
